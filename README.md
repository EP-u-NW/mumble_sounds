# mumble_sounds

This package provides access to the sound samples used in the [mumble](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble) project, which might be useful for an voip app.

All samples can be accessed in three different sound formats and with three different sample rates.

Note however, that this package just provides the sound samples, but does not contain any measures to actually play them! It is up to you to play them in a way that makes most sense to your app!
